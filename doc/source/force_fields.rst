ChIMES Parameter Files
==========

ChIMES parameter files are stored in ``serial_interface/tests/force_fields``. A complete list of availble force fields and
corresponding references can be found on the :ref:`Citing ChIMES page <page-citing>`. These parameter files come with no
guarantees and should only be used for system compositions and thermodynamic ranges indicated at the top of each file. If you 
are interested in developing a ChIMES model for a new material or range of conditions, please contact us
